# progate-project-1
This is our first project in Progate course by FGA's Kominfo 2022

We created a static web page (a single web page) that conclude what we've been doing so far in Week 1.
We've learned how to make a header, a proper body for an HTML webpage, a footer, and some animations within the webpage.
